* Which industry role(s) sound the best and/or worst to you?
I’m still trying to figure out what exactly I want to do or where I fit in, but I definitely do not like programming. I feel like I completely suck at it and I just don’t have fun doing it at all. Apart from that, I have the most experience in visual art, though I’m also pretty interested in narrative design.


* Which role(s) was surprising, boring, easy, hard, cheap, expensive, or ____?
I was surprised to learn that concept artists are actually paid more than other types of artists and that animators tend to be paid the least out of them. I was also surprised with how much play testers make compared to those who are working on the game.
