Discuss your process of working on your Rube Goldberg machine!
At the beginning, I wanted to figure out what sort of theme or concept I wanted to do for the project, which I did by deciding what things look cute as a circle. After considering various cute animals, I settled on a red panda since I have a circular plush of one that I could use as reference. Afterwards, I started working on the layout of the machine, trying to incorporate any different parts/phases I could think of (though I don’t feel very creative). Once I got that down, I started working on assets that would make relative sense with a red panda like bamboo and leaves. Once those are done, all that’s left is to implement them into the actual game.
