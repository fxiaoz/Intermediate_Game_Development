Discuss your process of working on your flat game!
The beginning of this project was pretty rough. Visual Studio kept crashing as soon as it would open, even when I quit other applications and kept my computer charging. I decided to take a break and work on the player sprites instead, and I settled on having a simple sheep since all I really wanted to animate was a little bob up and down. After some progress on the player, I decided to try deleting and reinstalling Visual Studio (which worked but was really weird). I had a hard time understanding exactly how the code worked, so I ended up breaking it down a little by writing the movement code in the way I’m most familiar with, then modifying the animation part to work with it. Thankfully, it was functional in Unity, so I worked on the transitions and timing between animations so it wouldn’t look too horrible. Finally, I did a simple space background since I thought a sheep in a field of grass was too typical. I’m not entirely sure how my reasoning for this lined up, but it basically started with the idea of counting sheep to fall asleep, which made me think of a starry night sky.
